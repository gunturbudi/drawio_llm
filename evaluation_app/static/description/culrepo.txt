Cornell University Library's repository serves various needs. Faculty members rely on it to access research materials and link content for teaching purposes. Cornell faculty members can also upload data and link it to publications for proper attribution. Patrons can stay informed about upcoming reports and datasets and choose to receive email notifications for new versions of selected items.
