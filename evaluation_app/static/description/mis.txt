As a collection curator and repository manager, the aim is to implement features that maintain data relevance and compliance with retention policies by setting expiration dates for data, which will then be either deleted or hidden before deletion. This includes displaying these scheduled deletion dates on item and component pages for better management and lifecycle review. Additionally, tracking financial responsibility for each item in the repository is essential for managing budgets and ensuring accountability for data storage costs, necessitating the ability to identify financial contacts and periodically run reports to monitor storage consumption. Furthermore, there's a need to enhance item visibility and accessibility across thematic collections by allowing items to be mapped from one collection to another, enabling them to administratively belong to one collection while appearing in others.
