NeuroHub is a system designed to support researchers in managing their experimental data efficiently. It allows researchers to track and document data lineage, share post-experiment findings, create a library of data for future experiments, and categorize data quality. Additionally, NeuroHub provides standard metadata for improved data comprehension and collaboration among researchers.
