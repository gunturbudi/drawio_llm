Stakeholders, user researchers, and research participants each have specific desires aimed at optimizing a content management system (CMS). Stakeholders seek to review user research outcomes to assess the CMS's suitability, while user researchers focus on testing the research plan through effective in-person interviews, finalizing task scripts with the OLPA and WIG prototypes, and ensuring the prototype's design does not detract from the workflow during user interviews. This collaborative effort aims to gather accurate feedback, refine user experience, and confirm the CMS meets the needs of its users.
