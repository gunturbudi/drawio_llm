RadCam is a system designed to empower archivists with the ability to manage digital files effectively and securely. It allows archivists to apply licenses or rights statements to files, ensuring clarity on usage rights; to mark files as restricted to prevent unintended sharing; to set automatic expiration dates for these restrictions, reducing manual updates; to limit access to files based on IP address, enabling controlled access in specific environments like reading rooms; and to identify previously scanned photos, facilitating efficient licensing to researchers.
