The system called Recycling is designed to serve both users and recycling facility representatives by allowing users to enter their zip code to find nearby recycling facilities, select types of recyclable waste to see which facilities accept them along with their opening hours, and view a map of public recycling bins in their area. Recycling facility representatives can update their information and the types of materials they accept to ensure accurate communication with users. Additionally, admins have the capability to add or remove recycling facilities' information to keep the system up-to-date, optimizing the recycling process for everyone involved.
