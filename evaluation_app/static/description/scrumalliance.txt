The Scrum Alliance system is a versatile platform designed for members of the agile community to customize and manage their profiles based on their roles, ranging from general members to practitioners and trainers. It offers a semi-structured format for users to describe themselves, enabling others within the community to learn about them. Specifically, practitioners and trainers can add detailed information about their experience and courses, including links to further details, which aids in promoting their offerings and facilitating course discovery by potential attendees. Additionally, the platform provides privacy options, allowing members to control the visibility of their profiles. Founded in 2001, the Scrum Alliance is a member-driven nonprofit and the only certifying body in the agile space, committed to advancing agility through education, advocacy, research, and community support, with a vision of making agile working methods so universally adopted that they are simply known as 'working'.
