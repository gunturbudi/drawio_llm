The University of Bath aims to develop an institutional data repository to archive research data long-term, motivated by new funder and publisher policies and insights from a Research360 data management survey. This initiative seeks to ensure data availability for researchers, meet external requirements, boost research impact through data re-use, foster collaborations, and support novel research endeavors. Modeled after the Opus publications repository and utilizing EPrints software, the repository will record and link to data in external archives and host snapshots of data that cannot be deposited elsewhere. Targeting University of Bath researchers and interested external parties, it promises enhanced access and visibility for the university's research outputs.
