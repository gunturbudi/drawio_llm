As a collection curator, I want to set a date after which data will expire and be deleted or hidden then deleted, to ensure the data remains relevant and to comply with data retention policies.
As a collection curator, I want to see the scheduled records deletion date be displayed on the item and component pages, so that I can easily manage and review the lifecycle status of various items within my collection.
As a repository manager, I want to track who is financially responsible for each item in the repository, who should probably be a person contact including name, phone, email, maybe title and address, to manage the budget and ensure accountability for data storage costs.
As a repository manager, I want to be able to run a report periodically showing the storage consumed by each financial contact, so that I can monitor and manage storage costs effectively and plan budget allocations accurately.
As a collection curator, I want to map an item or items from one collection to another, so that an item may administratively belong to one collection but could appear in other collections, enhancing the visibility and accessibility of items across different thematic collections.
